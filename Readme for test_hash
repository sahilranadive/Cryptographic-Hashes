The code uses a very simple hash function i.e. "and" operation to encrypt strings.
The code uses the hash output of the previous character in the string as seed to hash the next character.
Simply it uses 8 bit fixed encryption which although not secure, represents the principle of working of encryption algorithms.
Use hash table to store values in hash_table.cpp.
