#Brief write up on hash tables linked with linked lists
1. Hash Tables are a data structure used to store hash values.
2. Assume an array of linked lists. These linked lists are initially empty.
3. When a hash function associated with this table produces a hash value, it
searches for a place in the table corresponding to its hash value. In a
collision free hash table it should find that its spot n the hash table is free.
4. At this point it creates a node in the linked list at its spot in the array
and places the hash value there.
5. In case a node already exists at this spot then it creates another node in
the linked list stored here and adds this new entry to that point. This table
some other information in the node as well.
6. eg: Consider a Gmail account, the username and the hash for the password
could be stored at one location in the hash table.
